# Common mistakes and tips

- All the volunteers are there to help, lean on them as it can't be done alone.
- Ensure all rooms have water for the speakers and volunteers.
- Make sure you have every form of AV connector available and, if all else fails, arm your volunteers with USB sticks to be able to transfer slides from laptop to a known good laptop.
- Test the projectors, av equipment (such as microphones) the day before the conference.
