# Common mistakes and tips

- All the volunteers are there to help, lean on them as it can't be done alone.
- Check that anything that requires batteries or charging (such as clickers, mic packs, and more) are fully charged the day before.
- Ensure all rooms have water for the speakers and volunteers.
- Have backup speakers, items, and backup volunteers prepped and ready to go.
- Make sure to fulfil any sponsorship promises, such as "shout outs" or social media posts.
- Make sure you have every form of AV connector available and, if all else fails, arm your volunteers with USB sticks to be able to transfer slides from laptop to a known good laptop.
- Test the projectors, av equipment (such as microphones) the day before the conference.
