## Overview

This document is meant to serve as a guide for anyone wanting to run their own conference. It's not intended as a defacto standard – many conferences benefit from being delightfully weird and different, breaking the mould on traditional setups. 

Although this document is heavily focused towards cyber security conferences, many of the concepts can be applied to non-cyber security conferences and smaller meet-ups.

## Why run a conference?

If you are planning to run a conference, you should have a clear goal in mind for *why* you want to run a conference in the first place. It doesn't need to be a revolutionary, world changing, or ground breaking thought – but running a conference because "it ran the year before" or attempting to "keep up with the Jones'" will lead to a disappointing experience for everyone involved.

Conferences can be _incredibly_ fun to organise and run, if they're done right. Sometimes, however, they can be incredibly stressful affairs for everyone if not enough thought, planning, or resilience is built in.

As an organiser you should ask yourself if you want to *attend* a conference or *organise* one. Organisers (and volunteers for that matter) often don't get to see every talk, if any and can be pulled pillar to post sorting out problems, ensuring schedules are accurate, or doing other tasks.

## Organisation and planning

Generally speaking, planning and executing a traditional conference will follow the following pattern:

* Concept stage
* Support stage
* Promotion stage
* Building stage
* Conference stage
* Post conference stage

You should have clearly defined goals that you want to achieve at the end of each stage, and sometimes these stages may overlap, or repeat themselves.

Things will change, go wrong, or not quite stick to the original plan and that's **absolutely fine**. Understanding that things might go wrong, planning for those eventualities, and having contingencies in place can massively help to keep the event running smoothly.

### Branding

While branding may be considered a "nice to have" element of the conference, it can make a huge impact to many aspects you might not have considered. Similarly, sponsors may be put off giving money (or haggling down the amounts) if the conference looks a bit "too cheap" or that you haven't given any care in its' presentation.

### Budgeting

Understand exactly how much it'll cost to deliver a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) version of your conference and add on the additional "nice to have" bits later. Looking at other conferences' sponsor packs can be a good reference point to understand

Many sponsors will require an invoice to be sent to them and will pay within their own payment terms. This can be immediate, 14/30/60/90 days after invoice submission, randomly without notice, or even after the conference has run. Planning your budgets in accordance with when money is due is very recommended and while it may be tempting to stick things on a credit card in the interim, care should be taken to ensure the sponsors will pay on the time you think. It's not uncommon for organisers to be out of pocket or have additional fees they weren't initially expecting at the end of a conference.

Be aware that accepting credit card payments, or selling tickets on platforms like Eventbrite can incur fees. These fees may be a small amount of money in the grand scheme of things but if you're running

Having money left over in the bank account after a conference is an ideal situation to be in – especially if there's plans to re-run the conference at a future date (or help out another conference).

### Backups

Speakers can drop out for a variety of reasons – both in person and virtual – so planning for an eventuality where one, or more, speakers drop out is a very worthwhile endeavour. Having reserve talks (with speakers), a panel, mini-workshop, or fun item able to be dropped in to the schedule at the last minute.

Similar to speakers, there's a possibility an organiser or volunteer may drop out on the day. You should aim to build resilience into your conference so that, if an organiser or volunteer were to drop out, their responsibilities can either be spread among the remaining volunteers or reserve volunteers can be called upon on the day.

Having a shared document repository or password manager can help ensure that the event will continue regardless of what challenges it faces.

The show must go on.

### Controversy

While the vast majority of conferences go ahead without a single hitch, you should be mindful of who's involved, or attending, your conference and if there may be any negativity directed towards crew, speakers, sponsors, the venue, or indeed other attendees.

### Comms strategy

Having an effective communication strategy is important. Speakers, attendees, sponsors, and even volunteers like to be kept in the loop at every stage of the plan.

### Legality

### Location

During the COVID-19 pandemic, attending and organising remote conferences became the norm for many of us. 

### Logistics

### Multi-tracks

Many conferences now follow a "multi-track" format. 

### Recordings

Some speakers don't want to be recorded.

### Swag

Many conferences give swag to attendees and speakers 

As a speaker or attendee, swag is nice to receive but it shouldn't be something that is expected. Budgets can be limited, and size based swag (like t-shirts) can be a nightmare to accurately predict. Swag should be seen as a "nice to have" rather than a "must have" using the leftover budget from the sponsors.

### Team

Having a team behind you during the entire event is thoroughly recommended. Everyone brings different skillsets, opinions, and ideas to the table. It may seem, at the first stage, that running a conference is easy but there's a lot of factors that can be a massive time and energy drain which has a knock on effect on the entire conference. Sharing the load between organisers can help lessen the burden on yourself and allow you to enjoy the experience.

### Timescales

Giving speakers at least a month (ideally more) notice that they've been selected, rejected, or are in "reserve" allows you to solidify your schedule and publicise who's speaking at your event. It allows attendees, and speakers themselves, to decide if they want to attend your conference. It's rare that a speaker submits a talk proposal and backs out, but it does happen. Don't assume your speakers are local – some may have to travel quite far to speak at your conference so giving them as much time as you possibly can to organise transport, book accommodation, and perhaps even annual leave is a very good idea. Similarly, with volunteers – letting them know they're expected to help on the day can give them time to ask questions or even back out themselves.

Having clear defined schedules of when certain parts need to be solidified (such as venue, sponsorship collection, swag purchase, or speaker comms) can reduce the stress levels of the entire conference.

## Asking for help

One of the most important, yet unspoken, parts of organising conferences is the help and support the community.
