# Tracks, workshops, and villages (oh my)

TBC

Many conferences now follow a "multi-track" format. This can allow you to accept more talks than you originally had planned for. Be aware however that complexity of running a multi-track conference increases greatly with each additional track, [workshop](#workshops), or [village](#villages). Not every conference needs multiple tracks and, while it might be disappointing to reject speakers, sometimes the simplicity of having a single track is appealing.
