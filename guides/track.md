# Running a track

Each track should have an absolute minimum of 3 volunteers present at any given moment, each with their own specific task. These types are usually [MC](#the-mc-role), [AV](#the-av-role), and [runner](#the-runner-role). All volunteers should have a copy of the schedule for their track to hand, and be aware of any potential issues, special requests, or acommodations that need to be made.

## Introductions

Speakers may have applied to speak a different name to the one they wish to be introduced as. Checking with a speaker to understand how they want to be introduced, what pronouns to use, and how to pronounce their name can ensure the speaker feels welcome and at ease.

Additionally, it's a very nice touch when a conference introduces a speaker and gives the audience a bit of context for the talk, or of the speaker themselves rather than just "this is tom". Having a document, one per track, with name/handle, pronounciations, talk titles, speaker biography, and talk synopsis can be very handy.

## Track roles

Each physical, and virtual, track you run should have a minimum of 3 volunteers, with specific jobs, in the room at any given moment. These can be broken down simply as an MC, an AV volunteer, and a runner. Each has a different, but no less important role in keeping a track running smoothly. Many people mistakenly believe smoothly is equatable to efficiently however, it's the job of your volunteers to ensure the track runs to the best it possibly can within the timings of the official schedule and with the spirit of the conference in mind at all times.

### The MC role

This is the person that is representing your entire conference. It's often the person people will remember most of the volunteers in the room. Care should be taken to select someone who has a good voice of authority, that can command a room, and can do a bit of crowd control if needed.

You should choose someone to be an MC who's confident at public speaking, charismatic, able to keep the track to time, but also canny enough to allow certain talks to over-run (or indeed under-run) if the situation allows.
