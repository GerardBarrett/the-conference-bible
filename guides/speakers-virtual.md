# Speakers (virtual)

> _**Note**: The following guide has a number of assumptions, such as using Zoom, having a virtual community (Slack) with automations and bots, and using Twitch as a broadcast outlet._
> 
>  It's encouraged to take this guide and modify it to your specific needs.

## Introduction

Congratulations on being part of **{Your conference name}**! We’re excited to have you as part of an excellent line-up of other speakers. We’ve put together this document to explain how the conference will run, what you’ll need to present, and also to answer any questions you may have.

## Join the community

> This section should explain how speakers join the virtual community for your conference, if you have one. Virtual communities allow speakers to mingle with the organisers, and attendees, prior to their talk giving them new perspectives and maybe even encouraging people to attend their talk. Having a comms platform for speakers allows them to ask questions of the organisers, and resolve any potential issues, before their speaking slot on the day.

We have a **{Slack/discord}** community set up over **here**. Once you arrive (or if you’re there already), please ensure you make yourself known to the crew as a speaker. This will allow the moderation team/volunteers to give you access to our private **#green-room** channel for speakers to prep, setup, and answer any questions you may have.

If you need a volunteer for any reason - ask for help in **#green-room**, and someone will get to you ASAP. You can also type **!volunteers** into any public channel and a bot will reply with a list of volunteers you can ping publicly or DM.

Do drop by the community and say hello :).

Our official Twitter/X account is **@{YourConferenceHandle}**, the **{Twitch}** channel is **here**, and the **{YouTube}** channel is **here** - if you aren't already following, give them a follow!

## Meet your hosts

> Insert a bio of each host/organiser for the day so speakers know who's introducing them.

SAMPLE

## Platform

> The following section assumes the platform speakers will connect to in order to present their talks will be Zoom. While other platforms may be similar, it's recommended to run through the steps a speaker would in order to iron out any potential teething problems for speakers.

All talks will be presented using Zoom, and broadcast live on the official **Twitch channel**. Talks will be recorded and uploaded to our **YouTube channel** no later than **two weeks after** the con is finished (if you subscribe, you’ll be notified by YouTube when we push your videos!).

### Joining Zoom for your speaking slot

> See INSERT LINK for explanation of setting up Zoom to best handle broadcast and green rooms of remote speakers. The following section assumes the Zoom setup has been followed exactly.

We have a lot of speakers to get through in rapid succession, with many doing short slots. In order to make things run super smoothly, we ask that you be ready for your talk, and in the Zoom meeting room, around 20 minutes before your scheduled start time.

When you join, you won’t be in the main broadcast room but rather a “green room” with a volunteer who will make sure you’re all set up and ready to go (testing mic/video/slides etc).

### Presenting on Zoom

Most people will be very familiar with how Zoom operates. But if you run into any technical difficulties on the day - ask a volunteer for help, or fire a message in **#green-room** and someone will help out. It is highly recommended you use the native Zoom application, rather than joining via your browser.

### Audio setup

Zoom’s audio settings are really good out the box - but it’s recommended that you use a headset with a microphone, or dedicated mic (such as a Blue Yeti) rather than any inbuilt microphone to stop any feedback issues and ensure your voice is the highest quality.

Remember to turn your phone on silent and mute any desktop notifications too, especially if you're sharing your screen!

### Sharing your screen

Sharing presentations via Zoom is really easy. All you need to ensure is that you’ve put your presentation app (Powerpoint for example in this case) into presentation mode before clicking “share screen” on Zoom.

If you’re using a dual or multi-monitor setup, when you hit “present”, Keynote/Powerpoint will use one screen as “presenter” and another as the “output”. Please ensure you’re sharing the main presentation, and not the presenter screen showing upcoming slides and time etc. See below:

### Videos, Sound, and GIFs

Playing videos, or animated GIFs while screen-sharing on Zoom doesn’t work terribly well for the audience as the videos end up being stuttery and laggy. You can use videos and animated GIFs if you like, however bear in mind that your video may not share well and you’ll need to check the following options first:

### Zoom meeting details are as follows

Please join only on the day you’re giving your talk, around 15-20 minutes before your scheduled slot, using the following details:

**Meeting URL:** Your Zoom Link
**Password:** 123456

## Q&A

At the end of your session, the hosts will have an informal chat with you about your presentation and, if there’s enough time, attempt to collate any questions received from the audience for you to answer.

Questions can be asked by participants directly via **Slack** in the **#announcements*** channel by threading their reply under each title card (hover over the post and click “reply in thread”):

Although participants will not be able to message **#announcements** - you can reply to any message there. Volunteers will also attempt to collate questions received on **twitch** and thread them to the post.

## Live Demos

If you have any demos planned as part of your talk, we’d fully recommend you pre-record some footage before the talk in case anything goes awry.

Alternatively, you are welcome to sacrifice a goat or two to the demo gods before your demo but your mileage may vary.

## Con Schedule

> Timezones are an absolute nightmare to manage, especially with automated announcements. It's very highly recommended to use UTC even if only dealing with a geographically specific region.

Keep an eye on the **#announcements**  **Slack channel** and the official conference **Twitter feed** for upcoming talks throughout the conference. These notices are automated and will go out at the start of your talks’ scheduled start time and sporadically throughout the day.

Note all times are in UTC for the conference.

Full running order is available at **{insert schedule link}** and on the **#schedule** channel in the **Slack** community.

## And Finally…

On behalf of all the organising committee, we want to say a big thank you for being part of this event. We’re really looking forward to hearing everyone’s talks, and we hope you have a fantastic time giving them.
