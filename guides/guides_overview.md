# Guides Overview

The following list of guides are example templates you can use to send to speakers, volunteers, attendees, etc. Not all sections will be appropriate for every conference so it's worth reading a guide in its' entirety and filling out as much of your own information as possible.

As noted in [branding](/organisation_and_planning#branding), it's worth considering branding these up to match the look and feel of your conference.
