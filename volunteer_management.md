# Volunteers

Volunteers can be broken down into four distinct groups â€“ AV technicians, General, MCs, and Runners. Volunteers should be "stuck" to their role for the entire conference period (meaning that an MC shouldn't be pulled to be a runner and a runner shouldn't be pulled to be an AV tech) however, things happen. Understand your volunteer cohorts' skillsets and utilize them as best you can.

## Types of Volunteers

### AV

Will support the speaker ensuring that they are comfortable and understand if they can move around the stage or need to stay at a podium if they are not mic'ed up. AV can be a very rewarding role but is often daunting for a first time volunteer so a few experienced AV staff on hand will smooth this over.

### General

Signposting attendees to talks, controlling access to track's after a talk has started to ensure no disruption for the speaker. In the event of an emergency, they will form part of the escorts to safely leave a building.

### MC's

MCs are the face of your conference when you're not around. They will introduce speakers, field questions and "run" a track.

### Runners

Something always happens, use the runners to go and get the extra AAA batteries for the microphones, or to simply ensure staff get to eat during the day, it's easy to get caught up.
