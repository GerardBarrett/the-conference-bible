# Types of speaker

## New/first time speakers

First time speakers can bring new ideas, and voices, to conferences. Running a first time speaker track (sometimes referred to as "rookie" track) or indeed a full conference dedicated to giving first time speakers a platform can be very rewarding for both parties.

First time speakers may need more support and guidance than [seasoned speakers](#seasoned-speakers) do. Informing them what the 10 and 5 minute warnings will look like, how they'll be introduced, what to expect from the audience, or even showing them the presenter view of Powerpoint can give them a high level of preparation so they can purely focus on their talk.

## Mentorship

It can be worth offering mentorship to speakers who have applied. It may come as a surprise but both [new speakers](#newfirst-time-speakers), and [seasoned speakers](#seasoned-speakers), often jump at the offer of a [mentor](#mentorship) to help them finesse their talk, tweak slides, and give guidance on what to expect when speaking.

Mentors should be ideally people who are seasoned speakers that can guide a speaker through curating their talk. In order to reduce overhead, it may be worth excluding organisers from being on the mentoring rollcall.

## Seasoned speakers

Seasoned speakers are speakers that have spoken before, know the setup well, and can handle an audience. Regardless if someone has spoken once or a thousand times before though, letting the speaker know how *your* event is going to work is recommended.

Known speakers can be easier to corale time wise, if you have an overrun on your schedule for example.
