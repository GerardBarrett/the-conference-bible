## Mentorship

It can be worth offering mentorship to speakers who have applied. It may come as a surprise but both [new speakers](#newfirst-time-speakers), and [seasoned speakers](#seasoned-speakers), often jump at the offer of a [mentor](#mentorship) to help them finesse their talk, tweak slides, and give guidance on what to expect when speaking.

Mentors should be ideally people who are seasoned speakers that can guide a speaker through curating their talk. In order to reduce overhead, it may be worth excluding organisers from being on the mentoring rollcall.
