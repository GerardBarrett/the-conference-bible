Generally speaking, planning and executing a traditional conference will follow the following pattern:

* Concept stage
* Support stage
* Promotion stage
* Building stage
* Conference stage
* Post conference stage

You should have clearly defined goals that you want to achieve at the end of each stage, and sometimes these stages may overlap, or repeat themselves.

Things will change, go wrong, or not quite stick to the original plan and that's **absolutely fine**. Understanding that things might go wrong, planning for those eventualities, and having contingencies in place can massively help to keep the event running smoothly.

## Advisors 

Having a friendly face that's done it all before can massively reduce the pressure of running an event. Their guidance and experience can help because most of the issues that crop up, they will have faced and overcome. Conference organisers are generally disposed to assisting others run an event... provided you aren't trying to run one in competition with them ;)...

## After party

## AV & tech

Decide early about whether you want the talks recorded and shared online. Even if you choose not to record or stream talks, you'll need to consider projectors, screens, backup laptops, as well as the myriad of cables to connect devices to the projector (because not everyone has HDMI anymore).

Having a bag of cables, clickers, dongles, usb sticks, batteries, and testing the equipment *before* the conference is highly recommended.

When it comes to recording/streaming talks on the day, infosec conferences benefit from having the wonderful [Cooper](https://twitter.com/Ministraitor) – and his rigs – on hand to help at most conferences. If you're planning on using his rigs, or calling in his services, please [donate a mate](https://administraitor.video/buy_me_a_mate.html) or send him some sort of thank you. You can find his [full (and incredibly modest) terms](https://administraitor.video/organizers/requirements.html) on his website, [administraitor.video](https://administraitor.video). Simply put the man is a legend and donates a ridiculous amount of his time, experience, knowledge, and patience, helping film infosec conferences around the world.

## Branding

While branding may be considered a "nice to have" element of the conference, it can make a huge impact to many aspects you might not have considered. Similarly, sponsors may be put off giving money (or haggling down the amounts) if the conference looks a bit "too cheap" or that you haven't given any care in its' presentation.

Social media promo images, speaker cards, schedule books, and even slide templates (for opening & closing remarks) can make such a difference to the overall feel of the conference if planned for in advance.

Using templates provided by online tools, such as [Canva](https://canva.com), can help make this process much easier.

## Budgeting

Understand exactly how much it'll cost to deliver a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) version of your conference and add on the additional "nice to have" bits later. Looking at other conferences' sponsor packs can be a good reference point to understand

Many sponsors will require an invoice to be sent to them and will pay within their own payment terms. This can be immediate, 14/30/60/90 days after invoice submission, randomly without notice, or even after the conference has run. Planning your budgets in accordance with when money is due is very recommended and while it may be tempting to stick things on a credit card in the interim, care should be taken to ensure the sponsors will pay on the time you think. It's not uncommon for organisers to be out of pocket or have additional fees they weren't initially expecting at the end of a conference.

Be aware that accepting credit card payments, or selling tickets on platforms like Eventbrite can incur fees. These fees may be a small amount of money in the grand scheme of things but if you're running

Having money left over in the bank account after a conference is an ideal situation to be in – especially if there's plans to re-run the conference at a future date (or help out another conference).

## Backups

Speakers can drop out for a variety of reasons – both in person and virtual – so planning for an eventuality where one, or more, speakers drop out is a very worthwhile endeavour. Having reserve talks (with speakers), a panel, mini-workshop, or fun item able to be dropped in to the schedule at the last minute.

Similar to speakers, there's a possibility an organiser or volunteer may drop out on the day. You should aim to build resilience into your conference so that, if an organiser or volunteer were to drop out, their responsibilities can either be spread among the remaining volunteers or reserve volunteers can be called upon on the day.

Having a shared document repository or password manager can help ensure that the event will continue regardless of what challenges it faces.

The show must go on.

## Controversy

While the vast majority of conferences go ahead without a single hitch, you should be mindful of who's involved, or attending, your conference and if there may be any negativity directed towards crew, speakers, sponsors, the venue, or indeed other attendees. You should also take into consideration if sponsors are particularly controversial either in general, or region specific.

## Comms strategy

Having an effective communication strategy is important. Speakers, attendees, sponsors, and even volunteers like to be kept in the loop at every stage of the plan.

## Keynotes

Having a keynote (or multiple) planned early can help structure the overall theme of your conference and shape the talk or workshop submissions. 

## Legality

It's worth considering getting your conference set up as a legal entity. This can protect you as an organiser from liability, should it arise, but also give sponsors a legal entity to pay sponsorship fees to.

It should be noted that this document does not constitute legal advice, always consult with a legal professional and/or accountant before undertaking any legal partnership or liability.

## Location

During the COVID-19 pandemic, attending and organising remote conferences became the norm for many of us. Recently things have gone back to normality a bit with in-person being the preferred option however 

Virtual only conferences are slightly easier logistically but can bring additional challenges an in-person only conference doesn't have such as license costs for software, streaming ability, wifi connectivity, etc. 

It's possible to do a conference as a "hybrid" event, allowing virtual attendees to stream or watch.

## Logistics

## Multi-tracks

Many conferences now follow a "multi-track" format. 

## Publicity

TBC

## Recordings

Some speakers don't want to be recorded. You owe it to those that do to provide something worthy of going on a CV to share. Work with the AV team to ensure your vision of the end product matches what they will produce.

## Scheduling

Plan buffer time between talks to allow for movement between tracks. Don't stack a slew of talks together especially longer ones, we are all human and will end up fidgeting and dropping out of talks to break up sitting still for so long. Putting three hour long talks together could have some tactical seating of people skipping the middle or last talk in a set to preserve their attention span for later in the day.

## Sponsors

Having an idea of the types of sponsors you want to invite ahead of time can give you a massive leg up. Sponsors often wont want to share a headline spot with a competitor, or be stationed next to them in the vendor area. Deciding early what benefits sponsors will receive and outlining which ones you plan to target. It's advisable to target companies that have previously sponsored similar conferences or those you, or your team, already have a relationship with.

It's worth considering opening up sponsorship to smaller start-ups and community sponsorships at a reduced rate. While a smaller figure per sponsor may feel like a waste of time initially, it can be surprising (and heartwarming) when many community members club together to sponsor your event.

## Swag

Many conferences give swag to attendees and speakers.

As a speaker or attendee, swag is nice to receive but it shouldn't be something that is expected. Budgets can be limited, and size based swag (like t-shirts) can be a nightmare to accurately predict. Swag should be seen as a "nice to have" rather than a "must have" using the leftover budget from the sponsors. There's a sustainability aspect to swag to consider, is it a t-shirt that will fade after a couple of washes, or a gimmick which is discarded or broken a week later.

## Team

Having a team behind you during the entire event is thoroughly recommended. Everyone brings different skillsets, opinions, and ideas to the table. It may seem, at the first stage, that running a conference is easy but there's a lot of factors that can be a massive time and energy drain which has a knock on effect on the entire conference. Sharing the load between organisers can help lessen the burden on yourself and allow you to enjoy the experience.

## Ticketing

- "Pay it forward" style tickets 

## Timescales

Giving speakers at least a month (ideally more) notice that they've been selected, rejected, or are in "reserve" allows you to solidify your schedule and publicise who's speaking at your event. It allows attendees, and speakers themselves, to decide if they want to attend your conference. It's rare that a speaker submits a talk proposal and backs out, but it does happen. Don't assume your speakers are local – some may have to travel quite far to speak at your conference so giving them as much time as you possibly can to organise transport, book accommodation, and perhaps even annual leave is a very good idea. Similarly, with volunteers – letting them know they're expected to help on the day can give them time to ask questions or even back out themselves.

Having clear defined schedules of when certain parts need to be solidified (such as venue, sponsorship collection, swag purchase, or speaker comms) can reduce the stress levels of the entire conference.

## Volunteers

Putting a call for volunteers out early is incredibly important. Volunteers can have vastly different skillsets meaning some are far more comfortable being front of house "MC's" while others prefer some behind the scenes roles. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of your volunteer team is vital to keep the conference running smoothly. Consider asking prospective volunteers if they volunteer at other events, or what particular skills they have so you can adjust accordingly.

Volunteers can be broken down into four distinct groups – AV technicians, General, MCs, and Runners. While 

### Volunteers - AV

Will support the speaker ensuring that they are comfortable and understand if they can move around the stage or need to stay at a podium if they are not mic'ed up. AV can be a very rewarding role but is often daunting for a first time volunteer so a few experienced AV staff on hand will smooth this over.

### Volunteers - General

Signposting attendees to talks, controlling access to track's after a talk has started to ensure no disruption for the speaker. In the event of an emergency, they will form part of the escorts to safely leave a building.

### Volunteers - MC's

MCs are the face of your conference when you're not around. They will introduce speakers, field questions and "run" a track.

### Volunteers - Runners

Something always happens, use the runners to go and get the extra AAA batteries for the microphones, or to simply ensure staff get to eat during the day, it's easy to get caught up.
