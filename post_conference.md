# Post conference

Before the conference, pick a time to come back together and discuss the event, what went well, what didn't, final costs as there will have been costs incurred during the day. Don't do it the day after the event but ensure it's timely as memories fade.

## Transparency report

Consider writing a transparency report post-conference that outlines any statistics about your conference, where sponsorship money was spent, and any issues encountered. While it may feel a bit invasive, this can positively impact future sponsorship opportunities and pre-emptively stop any hard questions.
