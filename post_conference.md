# Post conference

Before the conference, pick a time to come back together and discuss the event, what went well, what didn't, final costs as there will have been costs incurred during the day. Don't do it the day after the event but ensure it's timely as memories fade.

## Feedback

Asking attendees, speakers, sponsors, and even volunteers for feedback is critical - especially if you plan to run the same, or similar, conference again in future. Feedback can help trim any "filler" parts of a conference out and give you, as organisers, a better idea of what needs extra - or indeed less - planning and thought next time.

Feedback can be collected via any online form method although care should be taken to tailor it to each group (for example - asking "what was your favourite talk" as a mandatory question if a sponsor has been stuck on the stand all day might lead to skewed results or worse, an abandoned form).

## Lessons learned

Schedule a call between organisers and volunteers to discuss everything that went well, and parts that could do with improvement in future. Even if you have no intention of ever running the conference (or any conference) ever again, this kind of knowledge can be vital for this guide, and other conferences that may encounter similar situations.

## Money

Any money left over could potentially be used for planning the next iteration of your conference. There is a potential that sponsors still owe you money after the conference concludes. It's vital to continue to chase this money until all out-of-pocket expenses have been recouped.

## Recordings

While it may be tempting to deal with the recordings at a later date, it's highly recommended to get them edited. Recordings of talks fall into an interesting category whereby it's partly (or fully) owned by yourself, as a representitive of the conference you're running, but also by the speaker themselves. Speakers are keen to see their own recordings released for many different reasons, and it's worth noting this should be treated with the umpost respect.

A process should be in place to quickly trim, edit, and upload videos as soon as possible during or after the speaker has finished their session. Not every session needs to go out immediately after the talk is complete but, from experience, the longer its' left, the more likely the recording is forgotten about or lost entirely. 

A quick process is indeed recommended but speakers may choose to rescind their initial approval of a recording being publicly available. It's recommended to upload videos in a private format first, with a 7 day window in which speakers can choose to opt-out of a public video being released. Alternatively, informing speakers long beforehand (such as during the acceptance phase) that talks will be published online 24 hours after their talk is finished alleviates doubt.

Stingers (intro/outtro/mid break videos) should be prepped in advance in as many different formats as needed. Most modern video hosting platforms have inbuilt video editing capabilities to allow owners to upload and edit videos quickly.

Investigate video hosting platforms limitations ahead of the conference, and doing trial uploads, can help reduce any problems that may be encountered during the upload phase. As an example, YouTube restricts the number of videos that can be uploaded in a 24 hour period for new accounts. Therefore it may be prudent to do an upload session at 11.30pm and 0.30 am (internet connectivity dependant) meaning all, or most, recordings are uploaded at a similar time rather than days, weeks, or even months between recording uploads.

Having a clear timeline of release should be (regularly) communicated to everyone before, during, and after the conference to ensure speakers can see their own artefacts online as soon as possible, but to also avoid consistent questions like "when will the recordings be up?".

### Subtitling

Adding subtitles, while a lengthy process, can add more accessibility to the recordings and open it up to a wider audience.

## Transparency report

Consider writing a transparency report post-conference that outlines any statistics about your conference, where sponsorship money was spent, and any issues encountered. While it may feel a bit invasive, this can positively impact future sponsorship opportunities and pre-emptively stop any hard questions, or incorrect assumptions by anyone external.
