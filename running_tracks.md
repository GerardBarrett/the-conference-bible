# Running a track

Each track should have an absolute minimum of 3 volunteers present at any given moment, each with their own specific task. These types are usually [MC](#the-mc-role), [AV](#the-av-role), and [runner](#the-runner-role). All volunteers should have a copy of the schedule for their track to hand, and be aware of any potential issues, special requests, or acommodations that need to be made.

## Introductions

Speakers may have applied to speak with a different name to the one they wish to be introduced as. Checking with a speaker to understand how they want to be introduced, what pronouns to use, and how to pronounce their name properly can ensure the speaker feels welcome and at ease.

Additionally, it's a very nice touch when a conference introduces a speaker and gives the audience a bit of context for the talk, or of the speaker themselves rather than just "this is Tom". Having a document, one per track, with name/handle, pronounciations, talk titles, speaker biography, and talk synopsis can be very handy. Simplifying it completely - even just introducing the speaker, as a representative of the conference, is a very nice touch.

## Speaker management

Giving speakers a quick heads up of what to expect during their talk – such as what a 15/10/5 minute warning will look like from a volunteer, how the MC will introduce them, and that Q&A will be managed by volunteers if they prefer.

## Timings

Speakers need a few minutes to get set up before speaking. Ideally, speakers should be in the room (or in a remote green room) at least 15 to 20 minutes before their slot. This allows them to flag down the conference staff and ask any questions they may have, calm nerves, and reiterate any requirements (such as not mentioning the company they work for, pronounciation of names, etc).

Sometimes talks overrun - and that's okay. It's important, within reason, to give speakers the full slot they requested so it's worth finding other areas where you can cut back on time (shaving 5 minutes off at a break, or cutting down opening/closing remarks for example) to keep it to schedule.

Planning a 5 minute buffer between talks can help deal with overruns and allow people to get to the next talk in time.

If, by some miracle, your track is running ahead of schedule it's crucial not to start talks earlier than billed on the programme unless a major shift has been announced – this allows people from other tracks (that might have run on by a minute or so) to have ample time to seat themselves in the talk they wanted to see. Starting talks early can lead to disappointment for attendees who miss a talk and don't want to create a distraction by turning up "late", but also speakers who were expecting more attendees.

## Track roles

Each physical, and virtual, track you run should have a minimum of 3 volunteers, with specific jobs, in the room at any given moment. These can be broken down simply as an MC, an AV volunteer, and a runner. Each has a different, but no less important role in keeping a track running smoothly. Many people mistakenly believe smoothly is equatable to efficiently however, it's the job of your volunteers to ensure the track runs to the best it possibly can within the timings of the official schedule and with the spirit of the conference in mind at all times.

### The MC role

This is the person that is representing your entire conference. It's often the person people will remember most of the volunteers in the room. Care should be taken to select someone who has a good voice of authority, that can command a room, and can do a bit of crowd control if needed.

You should choose someone to be an MC who's confident at public speaking, charismatic, able to keep the track to time, but also canny enough to allow certain talks to over-run (or indeed under-run) if the situation allows.

Keeping any Q&A as fair as possible (as in - not letting one person ask 5 questions and use up the full time) is recommended however it's imperative to use your judgement. Sometimes talks reach a very well rounded conclusion and there's no further discussion points. In these situations
