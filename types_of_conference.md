# Types of conference

Considering which type of conference you want to run and what format early helps planning immensely. While it's not impossible to run a free for all style conference, both in terms of speaker types *and* format, it can exponentially increase the difficulty when combining multiple in order to run it well.

## Format

There are three types of format your conference can benefit from - [in-person](#in-person), [virtual](#virtual), and [hybrid](#hybrid). Each have their own benefits, and challenges, associated and this should play into any consideration when planning the format of your conference.

### In-person

Pre, and post, pandemic this is the most common form of event you may encounter. Given that it's a purely physical event, it requires a suitable venue, AV equipment, and potentially catering, or security on site.

Venues that tick all the boxes can be difficult to obtain, and some may even object to the type of conference run at their location. Care should be taken when selecting sponsors, exhibitors, speakers, and even attendees in mind of the venue's own code of conduct, ethics, rules, or morals.

Crowd control at in-person events can be a logistical nightmare to manage. It's worth planning for "dilution" of attendees - such as at break times, or during travel to offsite locations (such as after parties, etc).

### Virtual

While virtual conferences tend to be simpl**er** (and slightly cheaper) to run than in-person events, the common perception is they're a simple event to run. This is a complete fallacy. While many of the challenges faced by in-person events may be simplified, if not completely erradicated, by running an online only event, other considerations and critical factors do raise their heads.

For example - if your virtual only conference charges for tickets, but half the conference wasn't broadcast due to a technical issue, the viewers may demand (and be right to enquire about) a refund of their ticket. This could, obviously, impact budgets that may already have been spent on swag or other items.

Similarly if speakers are "remoting" in to give their talk, this can be at the mercy of their local broadband connection or tech set up. Having a back up plan in place (re-recording the speakers' talk at a later date for broadcast, pre-recorded interviews, or even filling the slot with another speaker) that's well communicated to all involved can be highly beneficial.

Choosing the best platform for your conference, and testing the various edge cases, in advance is highly recommended. The guides section of this manual covers both what organisers, and speakers should expect from a virtual conference and it's highly recommended to read this.

In short - ensure your broadcast location has both a failover solution and a contingency plan for if the stream goes down, a speaker drops, or even hosts themselves drop out due to technical difficulties. Ensure your speakers (and organisers) understand the technicality of the tool they are using to host/stream the talk, and the entire structure is well tested.

### Proven virtual tools

The following is a list of tools people have used for various virual conferences. This is not a de-facto list or must have, rather a collection of "known good" tools that have survived many thousands of hours broadcast.

- Discord
- Gather
- Microsoft Teams
- OBS
- Restream
- Slack
- Streamlabs OBS
- Twitch.tv
- YouTube Live
- Zoom

### Hybrid

Hybrid events are marketed as bringing the best of both in-person and virtual conferences to the public but can be an absolute nightmare to manage from an organisational point of view. 

It's recommended to have a dedicated team, both on site and off site on the day to triage issues, fix problems, and field questions from members of the in-person or remote audience.
